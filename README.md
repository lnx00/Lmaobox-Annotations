# Lmaobox Lua Annotations

The Lmaobox Lua Annotations allow you to get static code analysis, type checking and autocompletion for the Lmaobox Lua API in your favorite IDE. It is based on the [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/luals/lua-language-server) and [Lmaobox Lua API](https://lmaobox.net/lua/).
