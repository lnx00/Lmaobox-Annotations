---This library can be used for interacting with the warp exploit feature of TF2. How it works: \
---You can charge up ticks to later on send to server in a batch, which will execute them all at once, it behaves like a small speedhack, a warp. \
---Warping results in a small dash in the direction you are running in. \
---Warping while shooting results in weapons speeding up their reload times -> some weapons can shoot twice - a double tap.
---@class warp
warp = {}

---Returns the amount of charged warp ticks.
---@return integer
---@nodiscard
function warp.GetChargedTicks() end

---Returns true if the user is currently warping. \
---Since the period of warping is super short, this is only really useful in CreateMove callbacks where you can use it to do your logic.
---@return boolean
---@nodiscard
function warp.IsWarping() end

---Whether we can warp or not. \
---Does not guarantee a full charge or a double tap.
---@return boolean
---@nodiscard
function warp.CanWarp() end

---Extension of `CanWarp` with additional checks. \
---When this is true, you can guarentee a weapon will double tap.
---@param weapon Entity
---@return boolean
---@nodiscard
function warp.CanDoubleTap(weapon) end

---Triggers a warp.
function warp.TriggerWarp() end

---Triggers a warp with double tap.
function warp.TriggerDoubleTap() end

---Triggers a charge of warp ticks.
function warp.TriggerCharge() end
